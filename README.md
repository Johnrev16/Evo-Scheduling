# Evo-Scheduling
A developed AI algorithm to schedule practices upto 18 choreographers (not fool-proof) designating each choreographer a 1-hour practice timeslot based on their weekly availability.

For future Evo Board use:

# OPENING UP THE TERMINAL

1. Open up the Terminal
  2. On MacOS (Press Command + Space and search "Terminal")
  3. On Windows (Press Windows button and search "Powershell")

The terminal should now look like: 

# MACOS TERMINAL

# WINDOWS TERMINAL 


# PRE-PRE-STEPS
1. Open your Terminal, and type in "javac -version" If your version is not 18.0 or above, then please proceed to Step 2.
(OPTIONAL) 2. Update your Java runtime (JRE) by downloading/installing the most recent JDK here --> [https://jdk.java.net/21/](https://jdk.java.net/)

# PRE-STEPS

1. Before downloading all the files, create a folder in your Desktop to store the files.
2. Download the Choreographer Conflicts sheets as a .csv file. Rename the .csv file to something easy to type (e.g. fall-22)

# STEPS

1. Download all the .java files and store them inside your newly created folder.
2. Open up your terminal.
3. In the MacOS terminal, type "cd Desktop/name_of_folder" -- so if your folder is named "evo-scheduling," you should type "cd Desktop/evo-scheduling"
4. In the Windows terminal, type "cd OneDrive/Desktop/name_of_folder" -- so if your folder is named "evo-scheduling," you should type "cd OneDrive/Desktop/evo-scheduling"
5. Now that you're in the correct directory, you can now run the program!

# RUNNING THE PROGRAM

1. On MacOS and Windows, type "javac Main.java" to compile the .java into a .class
2. Then, type "java Main" This should prompt you to choose the .csv file. Type that file name.
3. This should prompt a second question to choose which algorithm to run. Type "1".
4. If algorithm 1 does not INITIALLY provide a valid assignment, re-run step 2-3 with the first algorithm at least THREE TIMES. I
5. If that still does not work, type "2" to run the second algorithm.
6. If neither algorithm works, good luck! (do it by handdd)

If a valid assignment has been created, feel free to share this draft schedule to the choreographers and change any times that would fit best.
